# Handwriting-Recognition
Handwriting Recognition System
This project implements a handwriting recognition system using MATLAB and a deep learning-based classification model. It captures an image from a webcam, processes it, and classifies the handwriting signature using a pre-trained neural network.

Features
Image Capture: Uses a webcam to capture handwritten signatures.
Deep Learning Model: Loads a trained neural network for handwriting classification.
Accuracy Calculation: Computes a confidence score for recognition.
Data Logging: Saves recognition results to an Excel file.
IoT Integration: Sends results to a cloud server via ThingSpeak.
How It Works
Capture Image: The system initializes the webcam and captures a 400x400 image of the signature.
Preprocess Image: Resizes and stores the image for further processing.
Load Neural Network: Loads a pre-trained deep learning model for classification.
Classify Signature: The system predicts whether the signature is valid and calculates a confidence score.
Save Results: Stores the recognition results into an Excel sheet.
IoT Connectivity: Sends data to ThingSpeak for online monitoring.

run('D0965676_5.m')
The system will:
Capture and process the handwriting image.
Classify the signature and display the result.
Save the accuracy score to an Excel sheet.
Upload data to ThingSpeak.
IoT Integration
The script updates a ThingSpeak channel to report recognition results:
Field2 = 1 → Signature recognized successfully.
Field2 = 0 → Signature not recognized.
Future Improvements
Improve classification accuracy with a larger dataset.
Enhance segmentation for better signature recognition.
Integrate cloud-based AI models for real-time recognition.
